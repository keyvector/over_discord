A FiveM resource for seamless Discord integration.
----------
Over Discord is a powerful FiveM resource that utilizes Discord's API to enhance your gaming experience by fetching player information directly from Discord. This resource allows you to access a playerâ€™s Discord username, roles, avatar, and more, providing a richer interaction between your server and its community.
Features

- Fetch and display player Discord usernames in-game
- Retrieve and manage player roles for permissions and customizations
- Access player avatars for personalized experiences
- Easy integration with your existing FiveM server setup
- Adding more methods soon!

# Installation

In your `server.cfg` please add the following:

    set discord_token "discord_token_here"
    set discord_guild "discord_guild_id_here"
    
Once done, start your server and you should get a print stating that the authentication was successful; if you do not see this print, ensure that you entered the right discord token and guild ID.
